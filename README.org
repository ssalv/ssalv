* Salvatore Criscione - @ssalv

I am a *Senior Software Engineer* focused working on projects with a focus on *minimalism* and simplicity.

I have experience working with *Elixir*, TypeScript, *React*, and web development technologies in general.

I find myself comfortable with *Linux*, following these principles:

- *Minimalism*: Only essential components.

- *Security-focused*: Incorporating paranoid-level security practices by default.

- *Emacs*: I use mostly emacs for most of my stuff.
